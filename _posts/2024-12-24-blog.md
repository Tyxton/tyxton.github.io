# I've created a new blog page!

Previously, I have written every blog post from scratch using raw HTML and CSS... that quickly became tiring and very time consuming. Thus, I have decided to move toward Jekyll, a SSG, to streamline this and simply use markdown to create the blog posts instead of rewriting an entire page in HTML.

Now that I have made this switch, the main website, [tyxton.net](https://www.tyxton.net) will now lack a blog however, [blog.tyxton.net](https://blog.tyxton.net) will be a subdomain exclusively for this. Which allows me to keep everything together, but seperate.

While I am writing this and talking about the updates on the site, I intend to rewrite all of the previous blog posts and converting them to markdown, which could take a while.

## Plans for the main website

I've needed to create a personal portfolio, hopefully to land some jobs in IT at some point -- prove my knowledge. So that will be the next step, in fact this is a part of that. I believe that documenting my projects and progress will aid in the job hunting effort, while also allowing me to share any gained knowledge for those interested.

I've been putting it off for a while, but in order to turn [tyxton.net](https://www.tyxton.net) into a proper portfolio I'm afraid that I may have to re-style the site a fair amount. I'm not particularly excited for this because I did design the style of the site to look and feel the way I wanted it to, however, I don't think for professional applications its too appealing. 

As far as personal projects, it's been serving well, at the moment I have been self-hosting a fair amount of projects on the server end of things.


## Wrapping up:
- Streamlined blogging
- Working on tons of self-hosting projects
- Having a lot of fun!

See you around!
